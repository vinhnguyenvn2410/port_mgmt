Calculate your portfolio information with ease!
Hello,
I got a bit bored since the CFA level III exam got postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So i created something that helps you calculate some information of your portfolio.
Obviously brokerage platforms do provide these information however it's sometimes confusing and unclear how did they calculate those numbers. Also, it's critical for you to understand the companies' data.
Have fun!
